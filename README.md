## Aim:

To understand and apply the process of identifying user experience (UX) problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and developing user personas for different project scenarios such as a Mental Wellness Companion App and a Smart Waste Management App for urban areas.

## Algorithm:

### STEP 1: Understand the Scenario

Analyze the given UX design scenarios — Mental Wellness Companion App and Smart Waste Management App — to identify the target users, their needs, and overall goals for improving user experience.

### STEP 2: Identify User Pain Points

Observe or assume realistic challenges faced by users in each scenario.

For the wellness app, focus on stress management, emotional tracking, and motivation.

For the waste management app, focus on communication gaps, reporting issues, and service inefficiency.

### STEP 3: Write UX Problem Statements

Formulate problem statements using the UX template:
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."
Develop two clear problem statements for each scenario that highlight specific user difficulties.

### STEP 4: Select Research Methods

Identify suitable research methods to explore user needs and validate design solutions.
For example:

Mental Wellness App: User interviews, diary studies, usability testing.

Waste Management App: Surveys, field observation, contextual inquiry.

### STEP 5: Justify Method Selection

Explain the rationale for each method, showing how it helps gather meaningful insights about user behavior, emotional challenges, and environmental interactions.

### STEP 6: Create User Personas

Based on realistic assumptions or existing data, create at least two user personas per scenario.
Include:
Demographics (age, occupation, location)
Goals and motivations
Behaviors and habits
Pain points and frustrations
Quotes or statements representing user perspective

### STEP 7: Summarize Findings

Summarize how the identified pain points, problem statements, research methods, and personas connect to guide user-centered design decisions for both projects.
Highlight how the proposed solutions aim to improve usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.

## Scenario 1: Designing a Mental Wellness Companion App

1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements User Pain Points Identified:

● Users struggle to manage daily stress and track emotional well-being.

● Current mental health apps are either too clinical or lack personalization.

● Many users feel uncomfortable sharing sensitive emotions with strangers online.

Problem Statement 1:

"College students need a way to express and track their emotions privately because they find current mental health apps impersonal, which results in loss of motivation and inconsistent usage."

Problem Statement 2:

"Working adults need a way to manage daily stress effectively because existing apps provide generic advice, which results in poor emotional engagement and minimal behavioral change."

2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Chosen Research Methods:

● User Interviews: To explore emotional triggers, privacy concerns, and coping strategies.

● Diary Studies: To capture real-life stress patterns and emotional fluctuations.

● Usability Testing: To evaluate comfort level and engagement with prototype journaling features.

Justification:

● Interviews allow deep understanding of emotional barriers.

● Diary studies reveal natural behavior patterns across different moods.

● Usability tests ensure the app feels safe, simple, and emotionally supportive.

3. Creating Personas

## Scenario 2: Designing a Smart Waste Management App for Urban

1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

User Pain Points Identified:

● Residents don't know when garbage collection happens in their area.

● There's no easy way to report missed pickups or overflowing bins.

● Lack of real-time communication between municipal services and citizens leads to frustration.

Problem Statement 1:

"Urban residents need a way to track garbage collection schedules because current communication from local authorities is inconsistent, which results in missed pickups and unhygienic surroundings."

Problem Statement 2:

"Municipal workers need a system to receive real-time waste complaints because manual reporting is slow and unreliable, which results in delayed issue resolution."

2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

Chosen Research Methods:

● Surveys: To understand citizen awareness and satisfaction with waste management.

● Field Observation: To study how collection and reporting currently function.

● Contextual Inquiry: To observe waste collectors and citizens interacting with the system.

Justification:

Surveys provide large-scale data on citizen experiences.

Field observation exposes operational inefficiencies.

Contextual inquiry gives first-hand understanding of on-ground challenges.
