## Aim:

To understand and apply the process of identifying user experience (UX) problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and developing user personas for different project scenarios such as a Mental Wellness Companion App and a Smart Waste Management App for urban areas.

## Algorithm:

### STEP 1: Understand the Scenario

Analyze the given UX design scenarios — Mental Wellness Companion App and Smart Waste Management App — to identify the target users, their needs, and overall goals for improving user experience.

### STEP 2: Identify User Pain Points

Observe or assume realistic challenges faced by users in each scenario.

For the wellness app, focus on stress management, emotional tracking, and motivation.

For the waste management app, focus on communication gaps, reporting issues, and service inefficiency.

### STEP 3: Write UX Problem Statements

Formulate problem statements using the UX template:
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."
Develop two clear problem statements for each scenario that highlight specific user difficulties.

### STEP 4: Select Research Methods

Identify suitable research methods to explore user needs and validate design solutions.
For example:

Mental Wellness App: User interviews, diary studies, usability testing.

Waste Management App: Surveys, field observation, contextual inquiry.

### STEP 5: Justify Method Selection

Explain the rationale for each method, showing how it helps gather meaningful insights about user behavior, emotional challenges, and environmental interactions.

### STEP 6: Create User Personas

Based on realistic assumptions or existing data, create at least two user personas per scenario.
Include:
Demographics (age, occupation, location)
Goals and motivations
Behaviors and habits
Pain points and frustrations
Quotes or statements representing user perspective

### STEP 7: Summarize Findings

Summarize how the identified pain points, problem statements, research methods, and personas connect to guide user-centered design decisions for both projects.
Highlight how the proposed solutions aim to improve usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.

## Output:

[Experiment - 5_ UI&UX Project Scenarios.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23445181/Experiment.-.5_.UI.UX.Project.Scenarios.pdf)

## Result:

The UX problems, suitable research methods, and user personas for both scenarios were successfully identified and documented.
